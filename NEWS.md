# NEWS

## Version 1.0.0 (2025-05-14)

- Update vignettes.

## Version 0.11.2 (2025-05-14)

- Update documentation.

## Version 0.11.1 (2025-05-13)

- Update documentation.

## Version 0.11.0 (2025-05-11)

- Various minor bug fixes and refactoring.

## Version 0.10.4 (2025-05-08)

- Fix issue #1 [https://github.com/gregfaletto/fetwfePackage/issues/1](https://github.com/gregfaletto/fetwfePackage/issues/1).

## Version 0.10.3 (2025-05-08)

- Fix bug from previous centering and scaling implementation.

## Version 0.10.2 (2025-05-07)

- Add centering and scaling of covariates before ridge penalty added.

## Version 0.10.1 (2025-03-08)

- Add support for factor covariates in `fetwfe()`.

## Version 0.10.0 (2025-03-04)

- Add back in functions `genCoefsCore()` and `simulateDataCore()` for export, and add tests for them. (Though these more flexible functions are now available, emphasis for end users will still be on using wrapper functions `genCoefs()` and `simulateData()`.)

## Version 0.9.0 (2025-03-04)

- Changed implementation of `genCoefs()` to a wrapper function that creates an object that can be piped into `simulateData()`, itself a new wrapper function for the function that was previously called `genRandomData()`. The output of `simulateData()` can then be piped into another new wrapper function, `fetwfeWithSimulatedData()`.

## Version 0.8.0 (2025-03-02)

- Added argument `add_ridge` to `fetwfe()`, which adds a ridge regularization term to the (untransformed) coefficients in estimation, similarly to the elastic net.

## Version 0.7.0 (2025-03-01)

- Added function `getTes()` to get treatment effects from a vector of coefficients generated by `genCoefs()` and/or estimated on data generated from `genRandomData()`.

## Version 0.6.0 (2025-02-28)

- Added functions `genRandomData()`, for generating random panel data suitable for `fetwfe()`, and `genCoefs()`, which generates a random vector of coefficients that is needed as an input to `genRandomData()`.

## Version 0.5.1 (2025-02-26)

- Slight updates to handle cases when only one column or row of matrix is selected more smoothly.

## Version 0.5.0 (2025-02-25)

- Add support for data with no covariates.

## Version 0.4.5 (2025-02-22)

- Fix typo in definition of `lambda.max_model_size`

## Version 0.4.4 (2025-02-20)

- Update DESCRIPTION to align with CRAN requirements.

## Version 0.4.3 (2025-02-19)

- Change URL to DOI in DESCRIPTION.

## Version 0.4.2 (2025-02-16)

- Added more detail to DESCRIPTION.
- Changed how messages are printed to use `message()` instead of `print()`, and modified code so that all messages are suppressed when the argument `verbose` is FALSE.

## Version 0.4.1 (2025-02-07)

- Modified `.Rbuildignore` to conform with CRAN requirements.

## Version 0.4.0 (2025-02-07)

- Initial release of the `fetwfe` package implementing the Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects estimator.
