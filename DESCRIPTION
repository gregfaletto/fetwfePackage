Description: Calculates the fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE) estimator for unbiased and efficient estimation of difference-in-differences in panel data with staggered treatment adoption. This estimator eliminates bias inherent in conventional two-way fixed effects estimators, while also employing a novel bridge regression regularization approach to improve efficiency and yield valid standard errors. Provides flexible tuning parameters (including user-specified or data-driven choices for penalty parameters), detailed output including overall and cohort-specific treatment effects with confidence intervals, and extensive diagnostic tools. Also provides functions for generating simulated panel data formatted for estimating FETWFE. See details in Faletto (2024) (<doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.05985>).
