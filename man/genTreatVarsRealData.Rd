  cohort_name,
  c_t_names,
  N,
  T,

}
\arguments{
\item{cohort_name}{Character string; the name for the cohort dummy variable column.}

\item{c_t_names}{Character vector; names for the treatment period dummy
variable columns (e.g., "c1_t2", "c1_t3").}

\item{N}{Integer; total number of unique units in the panel.}

\item{T}{Integer; total number of time periods in the panel.}

\item{n_treated_times}{Integer; the number of time periods for which this
specific cohort is treated.}

\item{unit_vars}{Factor or character vector from the main data, indicating the
unit for each observation (length N*T).}

\item{time_vars}{Numeric or integer vector from the main data, indicating the
time period for each observation (length N*T).}

\item{cohort}{Character vector; identifiers of units belonging to this specific
cohort.}

\item{treated_times}{Numeric or integer vector; the specific time periods during
which this cohort is treated.}
}
\value{
A matrix with \code{N*T} rows. The first column is the cohort dummy named
\code{cohort_name}. Subsequent \code{n_treated_times} columns are treatment-period
dummies named according to \code{c_t_names}.
}
\description{
Creates a matrix of dummy variables for a specific cohort. This includes one
column indicating membership in the cohort and additional columns for each
time period during which the cohort is treated.
