\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Number of units in the panel.}

\item{T}{Integer. Number of time periods.}

\item{R}{Integer. Number of treated cohorts (with treatment starting in periods 2 to T).}

\item{d}{Integer. Number of time-invariant covariates.}

\item{sig_eps_sq}{Numeric. Variance of the idiosyncratic (observation-level) noise.}

\item{sig_eps_c_sq}{Numeric. Variance of the unit-level random effects.}

\item{beta}{Numeric vector. Coefficient vector for data generation. Its required length depends on
the value of \code{gen_ints}:
\itemize{
\item If \code{gen_ints = TRUE} and \code{d > 0}, the expected length is
\eqn{p = R + (T-1) + d + dR + d(T-1) + num\_treats + num\_treats \times d}, where
\eqn{num\_treats = T \times R - \frac{R(R+1)}{2}}.
\item If \code{gen_ints = TRUE} and \code{d = 0}, the expected length is
\eqn{p = R + (T-1) + num\_treats}.
\item If \code{gen_ints = FALSE}, the expected length is
\eqn{p = R + (T-1) + d + num\_treats}.
}}

\item{seed}{(Optional) Integer. Seed for reproducibility.}

\item{gen_ints}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, generate the full design matrix with interactions;
if \code{FALSE} (the default), generate a design matrix without any interaction terms.}

\item{distribution}{Character. Distribution to generate covariates.
Defaults to \code{"gaussian"}. If set to \code{"uniform"}, covariates are drawn uniformly
from \eqn{[-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}]}.}
}
\value{
A named list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{pdf}{A dataframe containing generated data that can be passed to \code{fetwfe()}.}
\item{X}{The design matrix. When \code{gen_ints = TRUE}, \eqn{X} has \eqn{p} columns with
interactions; when \code{gen_ints = FALSE}, \eqn{X} has no interactions.}
\item{y}{A numeric vector of length \eqn{N \times T} containing the generated responses.}
\item{covs}{A character vector containing the names of the generated features (if \eqn{d > 0}),
or simply an empty vector (if \eqn{d = 0})}
\item{coefs}{The coefficient vector \eqn{\beta} used for data generation.}
\item{first_inds}{A vector of indices indicating the first treatment effect for each treated cohort.}
\item{N_UNTREATED}{The number of never-treated units.}
\item{assignments}{A vector of counts (of length \eqn{R+1}) indicating how many units fall into
the never-treated group and each of the \eqn{R} treated cohorts.}
\item{indep_counts}{Independent cohort assignments (for auxiliary purposes).}
\item{p}{The number of columns in the design matrix \eqn{X}.}
\item{N}{Number of units.}
\item{T}{Number of time periods.}
\item{R}{Number of treated cohorts.}
\item{d}{Number of covariates.}
\item{sig_eps_sq}{The idiosyncratic noise variance.}
\item{sig_eps_c_sq}{The unit-level noise variance.}

\description{
Generates a random panel dataset for simulation studies of the fused extended two-way fixed
effects (FETWFE) estimator. The function creates a balanced panel with \eqn{N} units over \eqn{T}
time periods, assigns treatment status across \eqn{R} treated cohorts (with equal marginal
probabilities for treatment and non-treatment), and constructs a design matrix along with the
corresponding outcome. When \code{gen_ints = TRUE} the full design matrix is returned (including
interactions between covariates and fixed effects and treatment indicators). When
\code{gen_ints = FALSE} the design matrix is generated in a simpler format (with no interactions)
as expected by \code{fetwfe()}. Moreover, the covariates are generated according to the
specified \code{distribution}: by default, covariates are drawn from a normal distribution;
if \code{distribution = "uniform"}, they are drawn uniformly from \eqn{[-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}]}.

When \eqn{d = 0} (i.e. no covariates), no covariate-related columns or interactions are generated.
}
\details{
When \code{gen_ints = TRUE}, the function constructs the design matrix by first generating
base fixed effects and a long-format covariate matrix (via \code{generateBaseEffects()}), then
appending interactions between the covariates and cohort/time fixed effects (via \code{generateFEInts()})
and finally treatment indicator columns and treatment-covariate interactions
(via \code{genTreatVarsSim()} and \code{genTreatInts()}). When \code{gen_ints = FALSE},
the design matrix consists only of the base fixed effects, covariates, and treatment indicators.

The argument \code{distribution} controls the generation of covariates. For
\code{"gaussian"}, covariates are drawn from \code{rnorm}; for \code{"uniform"},
they are drawn from \code{runif} on the interval \eqn{[-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}]}.

When \eqn{d = 0} (i.e. no covariates), the function omits any covariate-related columns
and their interactions.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Full design with interactions (default behavior, with gaussian covariates):
N <- 120; T <- 30; R <- 5; d <- 12; sig_eps_sq <- 5; sig_eps_c_sq <- 5
num_treats <- getNumTreats(R=R, T=T)
p_int <- R + (T - 1) + d + d * R + d * (T - 1) + num_treats + num_treats * d

                          seed = 123, gen_ints = TRUE, distribution = "gaussian")

# Simple design without interactions using uniform covariates returned:
sim_no_int <- genRandomData(N, T, R, d, sig_eps_sq, sig_eps_c_sq, beta_int,
                            seed = 123, gen_ints = FALSE, distribution = "uniform")

# When d = 0, no covariate or interaction terms are generated.
p_no_cov <- R + (T - 1) + num_treats
beta_no_cov <- rnorm(p_no_cov)
sim_no_cov <- genRandomData(N, T, R, 0, sig_eps_sq, sig_eps_c_sq, beta_no_cov,
