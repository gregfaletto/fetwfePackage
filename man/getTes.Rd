\title{Compute True Treatment Effects}
\usage{
getTes(beta, R, T, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{Numeric vector. The full vector of estimated coefficients from the model.
Its length must equal the total number of parameters specified by \code{getP(R, T, d, num_treats)}.}

\item{R}{Integer. The number of treated cohorts in the data. Must be at least 2.}

\item{T}{Integer. The number of time periods in the panel data.}

\item{d}{Integer. The number of covariates used in the model. Set \code{d = 0} if no covariates are used.}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{att_true}{A numeric value representing the overall average treatment effect on the treated.
It is computed as the (equal-weighted) mean of the cohort-specific treatment effects.}
\item{actual_cohort_tes}{A numeric vector containing the true cohort-specific treatment effects,
calculated by averaging the coefficients corresponding to the treatment dummies for each cohort.}
}
}
\description{
This function extracts the true treatment effects from a full coefficient vector
obtained by fitting a fused extended two-way fixed effects model. It is designed
specifically for coefficients formatted by \code{genCoefs()} and/or coefficients
estimted on data generated by \code{genRandomData()}. It calculates the
overall average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) as the equal-weighted average
of the cohort-specific treatment effects, and also returns the individual treatment
effects for each treated cohort.
}
\details{
The function internally uses auxiliary routines \code{getNumTreats()}, \code{getP()},
\code{getFirstInds()}, \code{getTreatInds()}, and \code{getActualCohortTes()} to determine the
correct indices of treatment effect coefficients in \code{beta}. The overall treatment effect
is computed as the simple average of these cohort-specific effects.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose you have a fitted coefficient vector from the model:
beta <- your_model$beta

# Define the number of treated cohorts, time periods, and covariates:
R <- 3   # e.g., three cohorts
T <- 5   # e.g., five time periods
d <- 2   # e.g., two covariates

# Compute the true treatment effects:
te_results <- getTes(beta, R, T, d)

# Overall average treatment effect on the treated:
print(te_results$att_true)

# Cohort-specific treatment effects:
print(te_results$actual_cohort_tes)
}
