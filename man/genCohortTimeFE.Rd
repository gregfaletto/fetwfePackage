\title{Generate Cohort and Time Fixed Effects Matrices}
\usage{
genCohortTimeFE(N, T, R, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Number of units.}

\item{T}{Integer. Number of time periods.}

\item{R}{Integer. Number of treated cohorts.}

\item{d}{Integer. Number of covariates (used to ensure minimum units per cohort).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{cohort_fe}{An NT x R matrix of cohort dummy variables. The r-th column is 1
if an observation belongs to the r-th treated cohort, 0 otherwise.}
\item{time_fe}{An NT x (T-1) matrix of time dummy variables. The t-th column
(for t from 1 to T-1) corresponds to time period (t+1), and is 1 if an
observation is from that time period, 0 otherwise. Period 1 is the baseline.}
\item{assignments}{An integer vector of length R+1. The first element is the
count of never-treated units. Subsequent elements are counts of units in each
of the R treated cohorts.}
\item{inds}{A list of length R. Each element \code{inds[[r]]} contains the row indices
in the NT-row matrices that correspond to units in the r-th treated cohort.}
}
\description{
Internal function to create matrices of dummy variables for cohort and time fixed effects.
Assumes observations are arranged unit by unit, with T observations per unit.
