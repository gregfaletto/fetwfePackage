\title{Convert data prepared for \code{etwfe::etwfe()} to the format required by
\code{fetwfe()} and \code{fetwfe::etwfe()}}
\usage{
etwfeToFetwfeDf(
  data,
  yvar,
  tvar,
  idvar,
  gvar,
  covars = character(0),
  drop_first_period_treated = TRUE,
  out_names = list(time = "time", unit = "unit", treatment = "treatment", response = "y")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A long-format data.frame that you could already feed to \code{etwfe()}.}

\item{yvar}{Character. Column name of the outcome (left-hand side in your \code{fml}).}

\item{tvar}{Character. Column name of the time variable that you pass to \code{etwfe()} as \code{tvar}.}

\item{idvar}{Character. Column name of the unit identifier (the variable you would
cluster on, or pass to \code{etwfe(..., ivar = idvar)} if you were using unit FEs).}

\item{gvar}{Character. Column name of the “first treated” cohort variable passed to \code{etwfe()} as \code{gvar}.
Must be \code{0} for never-treated units, or the (strictly positive) first treated period.}

\item{covars}{Character vector of \emph{additional} covariate columns to keep (default \code{character(0)}).}

\item{drop_first_period_treated}{Logical.  Should units already treated in the very first
sample period be removed?  (\code{fetwfe()} will drop them internally anyway, but doing it
here keeps the returned dataframe clean.)  Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{out_names}{Named list giving the column names that the returned dataframe should have.
The default (\code{time}, \code{unit}, \code{treatment}, \code{y}) matches the arguments usually supplied to
\code{fetwfe()}.  \strong{Do not change the \emph{names} of this list} – only the \emph{values} – and keep all four.}
}
\value{
A tidy \code{data.frame} with (in this order)
\itemize{
\item \code{time}       integer,
\item \code{unit}       character,
\item \code{treatment}  integer 0/1 absorbing-state dummy,
\item \code{y}          numeric outcome,
\item any covariates requested in \code{covars}.
Ready to pass straight to \code{fetwfe()} or \code{fetwfe::etwfe()}.
